# LanguageTranslator
This app is based on the streamlit and it detectes the language based on the document you have uploaded and tranlates into any language you want using google translate library.\



Here we are using various libraries for language detection and chatting with the pdf, Furthermore we are detecting the lanmgauge and making sure it is translated to the desired langauge.

The document fully gets converted to the language in the code and makes sure the document is fully translated to the language you want.

It is fun.
